# 📄 AI Resume & Job Matcher

## 🚀 Overview

- 📝 **Paste Job Description** – Users can enter the job posting for analysis.
- 🔍 **AI-Based Matching** – Uses a powerful **pre-trained NLP model** to evaluate match scores.
- 📊 **Visual Feedback** – Displays match percentage and suggestions for improvement.

## 🏗️ Tech Stack
