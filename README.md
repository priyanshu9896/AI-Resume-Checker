# 📄 AI Resume & Job Matcher

## 🚀 Overview
This project is an **AI-powered Resume Checker** that evaluates how well a resume matches a given job description. It uses **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** to analyze the similarity between resumes and job descriptions, providing a match score to help users improve their job applications.

## 🎯 Features
- 📂 **Upload Resume (PDF)** – Extracts text from uploaded PDF resumes.
- 📝 **Paste Job Description** – Users can enter the job posting for analysis.
- 🔍 **AI-Based Matching** – Uses a powerful **pre-trained NLP model** to evaluate match scores.
- 📊 **Visual Feedback** – Displays match percentage and suggestions for improvement.
- 🚨 **Bias Detection** – Identifies biased words in resumes and suggests neutral alternatives.
- 🛠️ **Resume Improvement Tips** – Provides recommendations on how to enhance the resume for better alignment with job descriptions.

## 🏗️ Tech Stack
- **Python** (Core Development)
- **Streamlit** (User Interface)
- **Transformers** (Hugging Face NLP Model)
- **PyPDF2** (Extracting text from PDFs)
- **Sentence Transformers** (For improved text similarity matching)
- **Seaborn & Matplotlib** (For advanced visual insights)
